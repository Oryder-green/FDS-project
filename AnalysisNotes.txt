Stricter delay definition. More than 15 minutes late. The stricter definition
of delays (i.e., late > 0) gives...

Use departure delays to predict arrival delays...useful information.

Because departures are US origin, I can obtain weather data for these airports.
This is not the case for arrivals, since these may be international. I choose
to omit weather as a predictor in the cause of arrival delays, although this 
is likely/unlikely an important factor given that landings are more sensitive
to weather than departures and that weather was/wasn't an important predictor 
for departures.

Missing data for drier more temperate months which may affect the prediction. 
Most observations are for periods in which the weather is usually worse, so
may underestimate the affect of poor weather on departure delays.

Should use data from summer month...also miss out on data for summer months 
with high passenger numbers.

Robustness check. Rerun on the best models when excluding imputed precipitation.
